# **Reconstruction of wall turbulence data thorugh deep learning**

This repository contains several Python implementation of deep neural networks for the resolution enhancement of turbulent wall measurements and the reconstruction of turbulent velocity fields from wall data.

Currently, one case is available:

*   Turbulent-channel flow: DNS data from a turbulent channel flow with friction Reynolds number ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Re_{\tau}=180) 

## **Installation**

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

To generate the tfrecord files, execute:

```console
guest@local:~$ python run_generate_tfrecords_training.py 
guest@local:~$ python run_generate_tfrecords_testing.py 
```

To run the training procedure, execute:

```console
guest@vegeta:~$ python run_training_resolution_gan.py
guest@vegeta:~$ python run_training_reconstruction_gan.py
guest@vegeta:~$ python run_training_reconstruction_fcnpod.py
```

To compute the prediction of the testing dataset, execute:

```console
guest@vegeta:~$ python run_predictions -c channel -u 4 -m architecture01 -l 1e-4
```
